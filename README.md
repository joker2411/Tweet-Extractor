# Tweet-Extractor
Using this python file, we can download tweets of a specific hashtag.

Firstly, we'll have to log-in to twitter application manager(https://apps.twitter.com/).
We can get the consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret from there very easily.
Enter your credentials in the code attached and by entering the required hashtag, we can extract the tweets. But tweepy can access tweets only 2 weeks old. so, be careful with the dates.
